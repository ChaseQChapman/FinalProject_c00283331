***MENU will load other scenes as requested***

Everything works.

I will go down the list as per the requirements.
1) Has terrain, grass, trees, and water.
2) Has good fruits (apples, bananas) and bad fruits or junk food (cookies, cakes).
3) Bananas give 10 health 5 points, apples give 5 health 5 points, cookies deduct 5 health 5 points, and cakes deduct 5 health 10 points.
4) Has mega fruit (Large Pineapple), gives invincibility for 20 seconds(also shows invincible as health). points are doubled for anything eaten while invincible.
5) Displays health and points at top of the screen.
6) Has mini map that shows apples and bananas as green spheres and cake and cookies as red spheres (player is blue sphere)
7) Has alien enemies. They start to chase player when distance is less than 100. Player uses gun to kill ememies. Player gets 20 points and 10 health for each kill. Health goes down by 20 when ememy touches player.
8) Game has sound, gun has sound, good fruit has sound, and bad fruit has sound, also enemy has sound when is killed.
9) I used a particle system to create the muzzle flash for my gun. Each time the gun is fired and spark and smoke comes from the end of the barrel.
10) There is First person scene and Third person. Select from main menu upon start. 
11) Start screen lets the player select first person or third person. There is a game over screen that appears when health = 0, that lets you go back to the main menu. There is a winner screen that appears once the diamond is reached, also lets you go back to the main menu.

No major bugs that I encountered.
